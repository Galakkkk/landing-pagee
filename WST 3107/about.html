            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello, I'm Yasmin Galak, and I live in Cuta Duluhan, Batangas City. Out of my four  siblings, I'm the only girl, and I've had my fair share of quirks that amuse me, like people's loud eating habits or the repeated questions that can be a bit perplexing. On a more positive note, I have a strong passion for music and enjoy watching K-dramas, even when the subtitles leave me a bit confused.

                To be honest, I didn't initially choose the course I'm in, as I had originally wanted to become a Flight Attendant. Fear and uncertainties led me in a different direction, perhaps due to concerns about affordability and external pressures. Now that I'm in my third year of the IT course, I can confidently say that I'm giving it my all and working hard to excel!.</p>
